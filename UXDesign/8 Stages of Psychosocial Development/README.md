# 8 Stages of Psychosocial Development and How it Can Improve Your Digital Product
By [Sean Patrick John Paul George Ringo Doran](http://spjpgrd.com)

**Abstract:**  
The way your customer uses your product changes over time. A first time user sees your product with a completely different lens than your power user. With adaptive user interfaces and activity centered design, you can build out an experience that caters to the [8 stages of psychosocial development](http://www.simplypsychology.org/Erik-Erikson.html):

1.	Infancy & Hope
2.	Early Childhood & Will
3.	Preschool Age & Purpose
4.	School Age & Competence
5. Adolescence & Fidelity
6.	Early Adulthood & Love
7.	Adulthood & Care
8.	Maturity & Wisdom

Before you open either the Keynote or PowerPoint file, please install the fonts in that are in the `.zip` file. The 8 stages are **heavily reliant** on them.
